Instructions

In Assignment 1, your goal is to explore Tableau’s data visualization software using Tableau desktop or public. 
Your goal is to:
1. Create a dashboard comprised of three to five different charts and includes an interactive filter 
2. Describe the overall purpose of your dashboard as well as the reason for including each chart and the reason you selected the chart type
3. The data source you utilize should combine two different data tables.  Document the data source(s) and confirm that it can be openly shared
4. Describe the pros and cons of using Tableau (provide at least three bullet points for each a and b below) 
1. For a non-technical visualization creator (e.g., journalists, designers, communications specialist)
2. For a technical visualization creator (e.g., computer scientists and programmers)
TABLEAU
You may use Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop.  Either way, publish your work to Tableau Public and include the URL to your Tableau Public webpage in your submission.

DATA
You may use any data that you would like. However, be sure that you use that combines two data tables.  If you are not sure about this, ask the instructor or TA for more information.
Alternatively, I also have attached two data files that you may use if you would like.  Both of these excel files contain a sheet named "source" that describes where the data came from and some other information about the dataset.  Both of these data files contain two data tables (sheets in Excel) that can be easily joined in Tableau.
SUBMISSION
You submit your hand-in as a two page pdf.  
The first page should include a screenshot as well as a live link to your Tableau Public dashboard.  The second page should address Items 2, 3, and 4 above.
Deadline
Monday Sept 30, 11:00 pm Calgary time.
